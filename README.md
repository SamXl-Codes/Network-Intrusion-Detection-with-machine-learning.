# Network-Intrusion-Detection-with-machine-learning
Developing a network intrusion detection system involves leveraging machine learning algorithms to monitor and protect computer networks from unauthorized access and malicious activity. The core goal is to build a predictive model typically a classifier that can accurately differentiate between normal network traffic and suspicious or malicious behavior. This is essential for maintaining network security and defending against both external attacks and insider threats.
